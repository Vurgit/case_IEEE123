# case_IEEE123
A modified IEEE 123 bus balanced feeder in matpower case format(mpc) modified from https://github.com/LucienBobo/SOCP_OPF_Nick2017
intermediate buses are added on power lines, and closed breakers are modeled using a branch with very small impedence (1e-6 ~ 1e-7 for X and 1e-7 ~ 1e-8 for R)
The topology of the feeder is basically as in "Network partition and voltage coordination control for distribution networks with high penetration of distributed PV units",Y. Chai,
